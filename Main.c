// This is what I have to do
// step one, open files in and out which the program will assume that they are preexisting
// step two, read the in file for a rotation key that will range from 1 to 24.
// step three, complete a while loop while the EOF is greater than 0.
// step four, store the results in an array until needed.
// step five, print the array to the out file thus the project is done.
